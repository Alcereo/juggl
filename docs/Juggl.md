# Features
Juggl is a new graph view with many more features than the original [[Obsidian]] graph view.

## Styling
With Juggl you have completely control over the [[Styling|Style]] of your graph. You can use a special [[Style Pane]] that is very easy to use. For more advanced styling, you can use [[CSS Styling|CSS]] and [[YAML Styling|YAML]].

## Workspace mode
A very extensive new [[Workspace mode]] designed for keeping the focus on just the right notes. 
**Interactivity**: You can control the highly interactive graph using a special **[[Workspace mode#Radial context menu|radial context menu]]** and the [[Workspace mode#Toolbar|toolbar]].
- Select, expand and collapse nodes
- Pin nodes in place
- Hide and filter nodes from view

**[[Workspace mode#Saving and loading|Save and load graphs]]** so you can always continue your work from where you left it.

You can choose from **four [[Layouts|layout]] options**:
1. Force-directed
2. Circle
3. Grid
4. Hierarchical

### Code fence
You can use "[[Juggl code fence|code fence]]s" to embed graphs within your Obsidian note! You can even use the graph you saved in the [[Workspace mode]]. 

### More!
- **Mobile ready!** While still buggy, the graph works on mobile
- Has a **navigation element** that keeps an overview of the total graph
- Supports stylable [[Link Types]]. You can use this to add labels to edges, for example
- Supports a [[Global Graph mode|global graph]] for small vaults, and an Obsidian-like [[Local Graph mode|local graph]].
- Ready to be extended by other plugins through the [[Juggl API]]

# Implementations and licensing
Juggl currently only has an implementation for [[Obsidian]]. However, the meat of the code is not necessarily reliant on Obsidian and could be ported to other PKM software. If you are interested, you can contact [[Emile van Krieken|me]], preferrably on [[Discord]].

Note that Juggl is GPL3 **dual-**licensed. Contact me for details.
