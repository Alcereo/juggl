This plugin helps streaming your vault to a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)  database. This is a separate plugin to ensure non-advanced users of [[Juggl]] will not have to deal with installing Neo4j, and is completely optional for advanced users.

âš  Note: This is an unfinshed pluggin. Absolutely no guarantees that this works.    

Please refer to [[Install Neo4j Stream Plugin]] and [[Neo4j graph visualizations]] for more information
