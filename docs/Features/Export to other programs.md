Juggl supports exporting the graph to [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/ "Cytoscape: An Open Source Platform for Complex Network Analysis and Visualization") and [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/ "Graph Database Platform | Graph Database Management System | Neo4j")

# Cytoscape
You can save the graph in the [[Workspace mode]], then look in the Juggl plugin folder for the saved json file. You should be able to import this into Cytoscape desktop
